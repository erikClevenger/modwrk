		<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
		<p>My site will employ a single page layout split in to 3 sections.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h2>Welcome &amp; About</h2>
		<p>The first section of this site will act as a brief welcome and about me. In particular this is where I
			would like to have a button view my resume and c.v. As the intention of this
			website is to essentially attract potential work I want necessary information readily accessible. </p>
		<p>As far as the overall design goals go the focus of this site will be to make sure that it is very
			clean with next to no "buttons" visible while also making it very clear that there are other places to
			navigate to. I'm shooting for a mostly horizontal feeling layout.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h2>Portfolio</h2>
		<p>The next section would be my portfolio examples. This is the section where I show what I believe is my
			stronger work. </p>
		<div class="currentProjects">
			<h3>Current Projects</h3>
			<p>As my design and creative interests continue to merge together I want to include a sub-section of my
				portfolio where I keep information about my current projects. This is where I want to include a more
				ongoing and frequently updated portion of my site as opposed to the more static portions of the website.</p>
			<p>Going forward this is where I plan on having GitHub and headless wordpress integrations live.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="methodologies">
			<h3>CSS Methodologies</h3>
			<p>In the interest of having readily available information I'm interested in collating a resource of
				various CSS Methodologies and potentially Styles Guides. This section is inspired by The Gang of Four
				design patterns book as I have been unable to find a similar resource for CSS.</p>
		</div>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h2>Contact</h2>
		<p>The final section will feature the required contact form.</p>
