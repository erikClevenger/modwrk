		<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
		<p>My site will employ a single page layout split in to 3 sections.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h2>Welcome &amp; About</h2>
		<p>The first section of this site will act as a brief welcome and about me. In particular this is where I
			would like to have a button to display my resume and another to download it. As the intention of this
			website is to essentially attract potential work I want necessary information readily accessible. </p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h2>Portfolio</h2>
		<p>The next section would be my portfolio examples. This is the section where I show what I believe is my
			stronger work. </p>
	</section>
		<h2>Contact</h2>
		<p>The final section will feature the required contact form.</p>
