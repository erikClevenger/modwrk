### Milestone 1 Feedback
Nice work adding more specificity and detail to your Purpose, Audience, Goal and Persona. I feel that your direction here is now much more clear, and I hope this was a useful exercise and will provide you with a bit more direction going forward - particularly in Milestone 2a. 

The details you added to the Goal especially stood out to me. The following paragraph in particular:

"..._freelance interaction design and product strategy work. Ideally projects would be innovative, forward thinking, and community focused solutions for real issues as opposed to money grabs_."

This is great stuff here - I'm really looking forward to seeing how you plan to address these specifics with your content strategy and UI design concepts in Milestone 2a. 

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). There are a couple of minor code issues I saw, please see Edits &amp; Suggestions below. You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2&alpha;.

#### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Add `/vendor` to your .gitignore
- Remove PUBLIC from your !DOCTYPE on line 1
